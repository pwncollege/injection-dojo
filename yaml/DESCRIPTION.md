This module builds on what you’ve learned in the CSV module. Now, it's time to explore YAML injection—where innocent-looking configurations can become powerful attack vectors.

In the `yaml/` folder, each challenge walks you through how untrusted YAML input, especially with features like anchors, aliases, and complex tags, can slip past naive parsing and distort logic—or even trigger arbitrary code execution.

You’ll learn how seemingly harmless YAML files can be manipulated to redirect control flow, inject unexpected values, or break security boundaries.

Let your YAML manipulation journey begin!
