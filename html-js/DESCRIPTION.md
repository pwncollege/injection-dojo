This module will illustrate the power of HTML and Javascript injection. This form of injection, often refered to as Cross Site Scripting (XSS), uses both HTML and Javascript. Its process is different than many other forms of injection in this dojo, but is just as dangerous and common. It focuses on utilizing the server as an intermediary between the attacker and the victim in stead of directly exploiting the server.
