This challenge demonstrates textbook XPath injection, where untrusted user input is inserted directly into an XPath query without sanitization. The application queries an XML file to determine if you are a teacher, but because it builds the query from raw input, a carefully crafted username can alter the queryâ€™s logic. Your goal is to exploit this weakness, manipulating XPath logic, in order to gain teacher access and retrieve the flag.
