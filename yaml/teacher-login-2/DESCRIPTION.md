In this challenge, the goal is to manipulate the YAML file used to store the logins of users to get the program to think you are the teacher. You will need to inject a string that seamlessly integrates with the structure of YAML in order to do so.

----
**HINT:** Try testing what different logins do to the YAML file to understand the structure.
